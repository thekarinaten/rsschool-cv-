## I'm aimed at succeeding in doing what I like. That's why I chose front-end development. I've always been interested in programming, but wasn't aware of front-end development until my brother told me about it. I don't have any working experience yet but I'm ready to work hard, learn new things, get required skills. 

## My current skills:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git, GitHub
- UX/UI design
- Figma
- Adobe XD

## Code examples:

## Education

- High-school 

## English skills:

- English level: B2-B2+

I speak English everyday because I have friends from the US and since they can't speak my native language we have to speak English. I started learning it in school when I was in the 3rd grade. When I was 13 I started watching series and movies in English. Tried to find English-speaking friends but my English wasn't good enough so it was difficult to communicate. But I continued watching everything in English. And last year I found a couple of friends from th US who I talk to on the phone on daily basis and we don't feel any language barriers.
