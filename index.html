I started learning it in school when I was in the 3rd grade. When I was 13 I started watching series and movies in English. Tried to find English-speaking friends but my English wasn't good enough so it was difficult to communicate. But I continued watching everything in English. And last year I found a couple of friends from th US who I talk to on the phone on daily basis and we don't feel any language barriers.</li>
